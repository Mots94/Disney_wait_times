## Exploratory Data Analysis
One of the first challenges related to exploring our target variable was determining how to handle multiple CSVs in Pandas.  Upon researching this topic, I found that a Pandas module called glob could read in multiple files at once, which could be stored in a list and subsequently concatenated into one DataFrame.  I utilized the head and describe methods to view the DataFrame and the data's descriptive statistics.  This DataFrame originally consisted of about two million rows, and what stood out the most were the minimum and maximum values.  The minimum value of these datasets was -92918, and the maximum was 1511.  Time cannot be negative, and a ride wait time of about 25 hours did not seem realistic.  Both of the rows containg these values were dropped, and df.describe() was called again to determine if any other strange values existed.  One other wait time recorded was 952 minutes, which also did not seem realistic as a ride wait time.  The row containing this value was dropped as well.

Another challenge my group and I discussed was the fact that the number of actual wait time observations were not consistent from day to day and ride to ride.  We decided that before I continued data cleaning, each ride should have a mean value calculated by day.  We felt this would yield more consistent data for our target variable, so a separate notebook was used to loop through each dataset to calculate a grouped mean.
